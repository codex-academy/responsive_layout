				<h2>Speech one.</h2>

				I thought of the families I've met who were struggling to get by without a loved one's full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but who still lacked long-term health benefits because they were Reservists. In the end, that's what this election is about. And slowly, I came to realize that something was missing as well - that without an anchor for my beliefs, without a commitment to a particular community of faith, at some level I would always remain apart, and alone. It's the wisdom Moses imparted to those who would succeed him. Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough! This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive. I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow.

		<h2>The end</h2>
		I learned that everyone's got a sacred story when you take the time to listen. Yet what we also understand is that our values should express themselves not just through our churches or synagogues, temples or mosques; they should express themselves through our government. Their experience is the immigrant experience - as far as they're concerned, no one's handed them anything, they've built it from scratch. Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values.
